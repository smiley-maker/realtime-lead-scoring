# Real-Time Lead Scoring Pipeline

> *Connecting homebuyers with the right agents using ML-powered streaming analytics*

This project implements a Real-Time Lead Prioritization System using a Spark Structured Streaming pipeline to immediately score new user activity with 90% test accuracy. It utilizes a SparkML Random Forest Classifier trained on historical data to predict the probability of lead conversion (contacting an agent).

## Project Overview

You will also provide a writeup of your project. This should include a high-level description of
your data. This includes where you found it and what the data represents. You should also
discuss the ML problem you are trying to solve. This includes what ML algorithms you used and
how accurate their results were. Some sample results along with the high-level analysis of your
work would be good to include as well. You should also discuss how you handled the streaming
section of the project. And lastly, please discuss any issues you ran into from cleaning data to
applying ML algorithms to streaming

This project identifies whether Zillow site visitors are likely to contact an agent when viewing a listing. In other words, it presents a real time lead scoring pipeline for determining user intent (e.g. just casually looking around, or actually interested in buying/renting). The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amritachatterjee09/lead-scoring-dataset/) was actually targeted for web interactions for an education company, but I targeted the data towards Zillow with similar intents for course purchase or home buying. The target variable in the updated scenario is whether a user will click the contact agent button or not, making this a binary classification problem where users estimated to contact the agent based on previous interactions may be prioritized by the real estate agent as high interest leads. I used a Random Forest classifier model within a pipeline that included imputing null values with the mean of numeric columns, bucketing, string indexing and one hot encoding on categorical features, and a VectorAssembler to create the features array. 

The baseline Random Forest model pipeline performed well on both the training and validation set (which were gathered from the original training set with and 80/20 split). The overall accuracy was around 87%, and there are details about other metrics collected below. There was consistent training and evaluation accuracy, suggesting the model was not overfit or underfit. Future experimentation is needed to fine tune the model parameters and preprocessing steps. With some additional exploration of the features, I think that removing the city and country columns may improve the accuracy. At first I thought they would be important for a real estate context, but on further inspection both columns have a lot of missing data, and there doesn't seem to be a direct connection between that and whether the user contacts an agent. 

The model was used in a real time streaming setup, with data currently being simulated by breaking up the test dataset into 100 batches and saving those as parquet files. The source has a max files setting of 1 to better exemplify real world streaming. The query simply applied the model to the data without performing any aggregates, and the sink currently is set to output in the terminal. The output includes the prediction, prediction probabilities, ground truth, and the id of the user. I would like to explore alternative sinks, such as outputting to a sql table or postgres database that could be used with a model monitoring dashboard for further testing and even retraining policies. 

One pitfall of the current approach is that null values weren't removed from categorical variables during preprocessing. I think this could improve the training, but at the time I thought the null values would be treated as a class even if they were renamed. But, in hindsight I realize that the performance could be improved by aggregating from other non-null data points. For example, the data could be imputed with the most commonly occuring class, or with some data driven choice by comparing similarity to non-null rows.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation

The pipeline starts by transforming raw Kaggle lead scoring data into training and streaming datasets:

- **Cleans and validates** 9,240 historical lead records
- **Splits data** into 70% training (6,468 records) and 30% streaming simulation (2,772 records)
- **Repartitions** streaming data into 100 files to simulate real-time arrival
- **Saves as Parquet** for efficient columnar storage (5x smaller than CSV)
```bash
python -m src.data.prepare_data
```

**Output:**
- `data/processed/training_data.parquet` - Ready for model training
- `data/stream/user_events/` - 50 partitioned files for streaming

### 2. Model Training

Trains a Random Forest classifier within a Spark ML pipeline:

**Features Used:**
- **Behavioral:** Property views, browsing time, pages per session
- **Engagement:** Lead capture channel, referral source, last action
- **Geographic:** City, country
- **Status:** Lead status tags

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Imputation** - Fill missing values with mean
2. **Bucketization** - Group property views into bins
3. **Encoding** - One-hot encode 7 categorical features
4. **Assembly** - Combine all features into vector
5. **Classification** - Random Forest (100 trees, depth 10)
```bash
python -m src.models.train
```

**Output:**
- `models/lead_scoring_model/` - Trained pipeline (all transformations + model)
- `models/metrics/training_metrics.json` - Performance metrics

### 3. Real-Time Scoring

Processes streaming data using Spark Structured Streaming:

- **Reads** partitioned files one at a time (simulates real-time events)
- **Applies** the complete ML pipeline (feature engineering + prediction)
- **Scores** each lead with conversion probability
- **Outputs** to console (additional sinks in progress)
```bash
python -m src.streaming.spark_streaming
```
